# study
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model for stock prices, specifically focusing on the energy sector represented by the ticker symbol "XLE." By analyzing historical data and employing machine learning algorithms, the project endeavors to forecast future price movements, aiding investors in making informed decisions.
Features




Data Retrieval: Utilizes APIs and libraries such as Yahoo Finance, Alpaca Trade API, and Yahoo_fin to fetch histoThis Python project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes various libraries and APIs to fetch and analyze stock data, train a machine learning model, and make predictions.
rical stock data.



Options Data Analysis: Extracts and analyzes options data using Yahoo_fin library to identify potential market trends.
Energy Prices Comparison: Compares and analyzes the spot prices of crude oil, natural gas, and coal alongside stock prices for comprehensive insights.
Machine Learning Model: Constructs a machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Visualization: Employs visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and HoloViews to visualize stock prices, percentage changes, and standard deviations for better understanding and analysis.


###Installation
To run the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
!pip install -r requirements.txt 
Make sure to replace requirements.txt with the actual name of your requirements file if it differs.
Usage


Set Up API Keys: Obtain API keys for services like Alpaca and ensure they are correctly configured in the environment file (alpaca.env).
Run the Code: Execute the Python script to fetch data, train the machine learning model, and make predictions.
Explore Results: Analyze the output, including predicted stock prices, visualizations, and performance metrics of the machine learning model.
